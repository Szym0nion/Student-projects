H-axis segmentation: We segment the image in the horizontal axis to identify areas where cells have attached to the biomaterial. This segmentation is key step in the analysis process.

Automatic counting of black points: After segmentation, we proceed to automatic counting of black dots that correspond to attached cells.

This allows obtaining quantitative data on the thrombogenicity of the biomaterial. A graph of the number of points depending on the distance from the image axis: The next step is to create a graph in which we present the number of points depending on the distance from the image axis. This the graph allows for a better understanding of the distribution of attached cells and can provide relevant research information.

**Conclusions:**
- The further from the center of the image, the more cells visible in the photo
- The shorter the examination duration, the fewer cells spread away from the center of the image
- The greater the distance from the center of the image, the less stress
- The cells spread disproportionately in both directions from the center of the image
