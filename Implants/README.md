## **Knee joint endoprosthesis - tibial component (Inventor)**

The aim of the project is to develop a structural form with the selection of geometric features and appropriate knee replacement materials. The completed model is to have technical documentation and framework technological process (including material batch and quality control). The design also leads to the inclusion of appropriate machines/devices necessary to perform individual PT treatments/surgeries

**Technological process**

**Stages:**

1. Geometric design of the tibial element of the knee joint endoprosthesis
using CAD/CAM software.
2. Selection of appropriate Ti-6Al-4V input material, ensuring appropriate
quality and purity of the raw material and preparing it for processing (shaft).
3. Machining the material to appropriate dimensions in a CNC lathe.
4. Material processing to obtain the appropriate shape and dimensions of the element
tibia in a CNC lathe.
5. Surface treatment to improve the surface quality of the element, e.g.
grinding, turning or milling.
6. Tap for making a thread.
7. Quality control of the machining process and the finished element, including dimension measurement,
analysis of material microstructure, examination of mechanical and chemical properties,
e.g. hardness, strength, corrosion resistance.

8. Making the engraving.
9. Sterilization using gamma radiation. Exhibited items on
gamma radiation generated by a radioactive source such as cobalt 60 or cesium-137.
10. Preparation of the surface of the tibial element for installation of the joint insert
by applying special glue or cement.
11. Assembling the endoprosthesis by attaching the tibial element with the joint insert,
and then placing them in the patient's limb.
**List of machines and devices:**
